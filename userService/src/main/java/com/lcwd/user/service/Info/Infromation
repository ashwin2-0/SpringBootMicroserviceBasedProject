Purpose of adding

    config:
        import: "optional:configserver:http://localhost:8085/"

        this in application.yml file of any microservice
        will make that microservice a config client
        and that microservice will come to this config server to get all the configuration information
        from this config server
        here as our config server which is central breain whic connected to the Git     hub repo
        is running on localhost:8085
        so we have given the url of config server in the import statement
        and we have made it optional so that if config server is down
        then also our microservice will run with the default configuration present in its own application.yml file
//
//  similarly you can give the url of config server present on any other system also
//    like http://visionforgex:8085/
//
//  after adding this import statement in the application.yml file of any microservice
//   you need to restart that microservice to get the configuration from config server
//
//  Note:  after adding this import statement in the application.yml file of any microservice
//   you need to restart that microservice to get the configuration from config server
//

if u write     profiles:
                   active: prod then it will look for application-prod.yml file in this config server
                   and give all the configuration present in that file to the microservice which is requesting
