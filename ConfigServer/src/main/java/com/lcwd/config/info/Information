 this  file is created for giving information about this config server project

 when when you configure the application.yml file in any microservice
 then that microservice will come to this config server and get all the information
 about the configuration from this config server

 in short ye config server git hub se configuration le k aayega microservice ko dega bassss
  aur kisi bhi service  ko aise git hub se information lene ke liye usko config client banana padega jaise ki humne abhi tak kiya hai
    by default config server will look for "default" profile
   to enable this application as config server we have used
    @EnableConfigServer
    in the main class of this project
    and add below dependency in pom.xml file
       <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
    </dependency>


 here as there no profile is given to select hence by default in log it will show as "default" profile is being used


 No active profile set, falling back to 1 default profile: "default"
 When u will hit http://visionforgex:8085/application/default
    then you will get all the configuration present in this config server in application.yml file
    there you can configure spring:  application:  name: defaultconfig to test this.yml file

    in the same way if you hit http://visionforgex:8085/application/dev
    then in that case it will look for application-dev.yml file in this config server
    and give all the configuration present in that file to the microservice which is requesting
    for checking you can again give spring:  application:  name: DEV PROFILE SERVICE to test this.yml file
